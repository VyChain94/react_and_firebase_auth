# User Authentication with React Router & Firebase

This project feature is key for any project that desires to securely allow users to sign in to our app using one or more sign-in methods, specifically email address and password sign-in.

## Motivation

The motivation for me to build such a feature has been motivated by my desire and passion to further increase my react and react-router-dom skills while implementing projects that I will be including in many of my projects from here on out that may include any sensitive dynamic input's from a user, or upon request from clients. 

### Build Status

The build status of this project is 100% complete and comes along with comments in the code for myself or anybody else that wishes to build upon or understand this code in a simpler format. 

### Tech/ Libraries/ Frameworks used/.

- Firebase authentication SDK for sign-in, sign-out, and log-out capabilities.
- React-router-dom v6, to navigate pages upon signing in signing up and logging out.
- Bootstrap for all the UI styling

### Features

The main feature that was implemented in this project was protected routes, thanks to the react-router-dom library, this requires a user to be signed in to view specific pages. I also took advantage of React's context hook to allow the access of user details globally, with any React component that is wrapped in the provider.
